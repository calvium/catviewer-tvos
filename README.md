TVOS Example (Cat Viewer)
=========================

I mean, who doesn't like cats? We certainly do, so here at [Calvium](http://www.calvium.com) we have made a Cat Viewer app to demonstrate how to develop for TVOS.

How to run the app
------------------

###You will need:

* A mac with Xcode 7.2 or up and the Apple TV simulator.
* Also you need an API key from [flickr](http://www.flickr.com). Itâ€™s free to sign up.
* Optionally an Apple TV to run the app on the device

### Steps:

* Go `tvosexample/` and open `tvosexample.xcworkspace`
* Find `API_Key_Header.h` and input your flickr API key 
* Select your tv simulator and hit run
* Get some popcorn and watch those cute kitties! :)
